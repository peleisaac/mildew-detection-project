        ### üè¢ Business Context
        Farmy & Foods, a leading agricultural company, faces challenges with powdery mildew detection 
        in their cherry plantations. The current manual inspection process is time-consuming and not 
        scalable across thousands of cherry trees located in multiple farms.
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement
        - **Current Process**: Manual inspection taking 30 minutes per tree
        - **Scale**: Thousands of cherry trees across multiple farms
        - **Cost Impact**: High labor costs and potential crop loss
        - **Quality Risk**: Supplying compromised quality products to market
        
        ### üí° Solution Overview
        An AI-powered dashboard that instantly detects powdery mildew in cherry leaves using 
        computer vision and deep learning, reducing inspection time from 30 minutes to under 1 minute per tree.
